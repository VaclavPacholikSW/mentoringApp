# mentoringApp
Muster for mentoring sessions.

Goal is to create an app displaying weather. Here are tasks which you should do to finish our app.

First of all, download the project, run **npm install** and **investigate files and file structure**. 
In folder **src/app/** you will find everything what you should use.
- app.component.html is base page.


## Tasks TODO
**1) update angular.json**
- Muster is compilable but Im using LESS for styling so first of all 
- you need to update your angular.json to use LESS extensions (see angular schematics)


**2) update package.json**
- update package.json so user can run command **npm run dev**   instead of ng serve â€“open


**3) investigate app.component.html**
- Create component for header, body and footer and connect all via modules with app.component.html


**4) create weatherComponent**
- Create component to display weather and connect it with header and body via module. 
- As you can see, this is shared component which should have input/output bindings.

- Add method to fetch weather data
  - (keep it simple, just fill some variable with mocked array of objects for one week)
  - method should fill data after 3seconds (to simulate slow request)
  - during "3s loading" busyState should be visible (ngIf+template)
  - use interfaces
  - use enums to prevent duplicate of statuses


**5) implement interactions**
- Header should request a single Day -> weather should display corresponding data to desired day
- Body should display all days available and expect output message -> weather should display all days and pass message if requested.


**6) bodyComponent interactions**
- create button with click function to reload weatherData 
  - button should change label to "refreshing" while data are loading
  - after data are "reloaded" weather should emit message back to bodyComponent
